# Current Initiatives

The work of our committee is achieved through collaborative *working groups*, which are open for anyone who wishes to help achieve our goals. Our current initiatives are below. Please contact the working group leader if you would like to participate.

**Anti-racism Working Group**

Goal: Collect ways SCS can be specifically anti-racist, gather student input, and advocate for these changes.

Meeting time: 4-5pm on Thursdays

Contact: vdean @-andrew-dot-cmu-dot-edu

**Social Connectedness Working Group**

Goal: Make it easier to build social connections both within and across departments, and encourage mentoring relationships.

Ongoing programs: 
* Weekly board games

Meeting time: 1-2pm on Fridays

Contact: hlzhou @-andrew-dot-cmu-dot-edu

**Orientation Materials Working Group**

Goal: Consolidate a unified set of general information relevant to PhD programs (Black Friday expectations, detailed mental health resources, etc.)

Meeting time: 12-1pm on Fridays

Contact: pkoppol @-andrew-dot-cmu-dot-edu

**Student Representation Working Group**

Goal: Working to get student representation on decision-making committees in SCS. We have two focuses for the summer: in the short term, trying to get student representation on the D&I Dean search committee (as they will be starting work soon). We will also be identifying committees in which student representation is needed and identifying structural barriers and reaching out to administrative allies in getting student representation.

Meeting time: TBD (We'll send a when2meet for interested members)
