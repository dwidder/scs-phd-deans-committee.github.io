1.  **Student Recruitment and Pathways**

SCS recruitment initiatives must build meaningful relationships with URM students in order to propel our DEI vision forward. Fostering student connections and partnerships with Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) is critical for effective DEI-aware recruitment.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**7\. Community Impact**

SCS should be intentional about the impact it has on the community and continuously work to be a better citizen of Pittsburgh. We should recognize that ‚ÄãPittsburgh is by many metrics the least livable city for Black people in the US, particularly Black women‚Äã and examine how we can empower and collaborate with Pittsburgh residents.                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
