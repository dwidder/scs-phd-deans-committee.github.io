# Current Initiatives

The work of our committee is achieved through collaborative *working groups*, which are open for anyone who wishes to help achieve our goals. Our current initiatives are below. Please contact the working group leader if you would like to participate.

**Student Representation Working Group**

Goal: Working to get student representation on decision-making committees in SCS. We have two focuses for the summer: in the short term, trying to get student representation on the D&I Dean search committee (as they will be starting work soon). We will also be identifying committees in which student representation is needed and identifying structural barriers and reaching out to administrative allies in getting student representation.

Meeting time: TBD
